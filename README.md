- 👋 Hi, I’m @NinthBonsai
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything that is able to be calculated.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit more about C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things I don't know about yet
- 📫 How to reach me? Well there should be some way of communicating on GitHub, if more is needed we will see ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
